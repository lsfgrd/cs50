# Harvard's CS50x (2024 version)
this is a repository to share my solutions to the CS50x problem sets.

my main objective is to cover all the "more confident" versions of the algorithm challenges. after I finish the course, I may go back to the less confident ones just for fun!

the problem sets were updated for the 2024 version as I'm back to working on this course!
